- Maintains all existing dependencies and configurations
- Type-safe implementation throughout

#### Component Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── modes/           # All 8 game mode components
│   ├── Header.tsx       # App header with reset functionality
│   ├── ModeSelector.tsx # Mode switching interface
│   └── SearchInput.tsx  # Reusable search component

└── App.tsx              # Main application component
```

#### Data Flow
1. **API Loading**: useGameData hook fetches and transforms data
2. **Daily Answers**: Generated using seeded randomization
3. **Game State**: Managed in localStorage with React state
4. **Mode Rendering**: Dynamic component rendering based on selected mode

## 🎯 MVP Compliance

### ✅ All MVP Requirements Met
- **8 Game Modes**: All implemented and functional
- **Daily Reset**: UTC midnight reset with shared answers
- **Unified UI**: Single input area with mode selector
- **Real Data**: Uses official League of Legends APIs
- **Offline Capable**: Once loaded, works without internet
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Zoom mechanics and hint systems
- **Visual Feedback**: Color coding and animations

### 🔄 Data Sources (Updated)
- **Live APIs**: Replaced static files with real-time data
- **Community Dragon**: Primary data source for game assets
- **Meraki Analytics**: Detailed champion information
- **CDN Assets**: Images and icons served from official CDNs

## 🚀 Ready for Use

The Wardle implementation is complete and ready for deployment:

1. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Start development**: `npm run dev`
3. **Build for production**: `npm run build`

### Features Working
- All 8 game modes functional
- Daily puzzle system active
- Real League of Legends data
- Responsive design
- State persistence
- Error handling

### Performance Optimized
- Parallel API loading
- Data limiting for performance
- Efficient state management
- Optimized bundle size

## 📝 Notes

- **Image Loading**: Some images may take time to load on first visit
- **API Reliability**: Dependent on Community Dragon and Meraki Analytics uptime
- **Data Freshness**: Always current with latest game patches
- **Browser Compatibility**: Modern browsers with ES6+ support required

The implementation successfully transforms the static MVP into a dynamic, data-driven application using real League of Legends APIs while maintaining all the core gameplay features and requirements.
